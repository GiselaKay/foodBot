# Project Name #

 ## Heading ##
 Food Robot
 End-to-end recipe and grocery recommendation service for people that eat. So. Everyone.

	
 ## Summary ##
	Upon signing up, the user will provide Food Robot dietary restrictions, time to cook, and budget. Food Robot will then search hundreds and thousands of recipes from its database and make recommendations based on your past input and current needs.

	As you approve recipes, Food Robot will order the groceries/ingredients necessary for your meals and ensure their delivery.

	Don't shop. Swipe.

## Problem ##
  	
  	For the most part, our grocery habits have worsened. The advent of fast food, diabetes, and obesity across America has shown that Americans as a whole do not prioritize consumption of healthy, wholesome food.

  	The overabundance of choice and information has paralyzed consumers. Preparing food requires research, a trip to the store, a search for ingredients, and a willingness to cook. Food Robot takes care of everything but the fun part: cooking.

## Solution ##

	Imagine a personal chef. In your phone. But it goes shopping for you, it knows more recipes than any chef in the world, and it gets smarter the more times you use it.

	Go Robot Go.
